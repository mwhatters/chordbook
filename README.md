This is a test to see if I can commit changes to github. 

The chordbook is a training project I've created as a tool to help learn the python language.
 It is currently only partially functional. It will be improved as I continue to learn.
This is also a useful way for me to familiarize myself with the working of git, github,
bitbucket and sourcetree.


README.md version 2 --
This is a test in which I've made changes to this very file, with the text you are currently reading.
It is a joy.
